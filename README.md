Creative Machine Learning Examples for 2020


Teaching resources for projects and workshops exploring machine learning (ML)

## Main teaching webpage 
[HERE](https://j3nsykes.github.io/)
Direct links to sketches live on the teaching website but local copies can be downloaded from this repo. 

### Teachable Machine
These  examples all run in the P5JS editor and import simple classification models trainedusing the [teachable Machine]() 

### ML5
These examples run in the P5 editor and explore varyiing ML5 functions such as classification, regression and pre-trained models. 

### DIY Neural Nets in ML5
These examples live in the P5JS editor and can be linked to from the teaching webpage. Local copies can be downlaoded from this repository. The examples show how to use the ML5 Neural Net function to build templates for training any input, in particular, Physical Computing inputs. 

### Physical Teachable Machines
A range of examples using a variety of training tools:
* Training directly in ML5 with the neural net function
* Training in the Arduino IDE with the Simple_KNN library.
* Training with Tensorflow Lite using the Arduino_TensorflowLite library and Google Colabs. 

A guide to starting with Arduino can be found [here]().
As there are different positives and negatives to the varioous approaches with Physical Computing and ML an in-depth walk- through of the examples can be found [here]().
### RunwayML
Within this folder are examples that build upon the existing RunwayML Processing library and further these interactions with text generating chat bots, speech feedback loops and motorised outputs and sound to name a few. Have an explore!

There are also some P5JS examples communicating with RunwayML for hosted models and expanded interactions.
